<h1>Hercules</h1>

<hr noshade>
<p>
Ever since I saw my first IBM mainframe (a 360/30 at Charter
Consolidated in Ashford, Kent in about 1970), it has been my dream
to own and operate a "real" computer.
<p>
Thirty years later, I still don't have my own mainframe, so I
created Hercules instead.
It's a little toy which will turn your Pentium PC into an IBM
mainframe.  Well, almost!
<p>
Hercules is a System/370 and ESA/390 emulator which can IPL and
execute S/370 and ESA/390 instructions.
It can also emulate CKD and FBA DASD, printer, card reader, tape,
and local non-SNA 3270 devices.
