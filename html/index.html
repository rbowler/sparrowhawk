<h1>The Hercules System/370 and ESA/390 Emulator</h1>
<hr noshade>
<p>
My first experience with a computer was at HemisFair '68 in San Antonio.
IBM had a pavilion there with some sort of mainframe (I don't remember
what), driving 8 or so 2260s (I think). It ran a program that would tell you
exactly how old you were, down to the second. Pretty mundane stuff now, but
to an 8-year-old...<br>
I broke into systems work 12 years later, doing MVS on a 370/158AP. It was
fun...but I wanted a box of my own. The long series of PCs I've owned since
then have been fun, but nothing quite captures the flavor of running the big
iron like, well, running the big iron.<p>
<p>
That is, until now...
<p>
Hercules is a System/370 and ESA/390 emulator which can IPL and
execute S/370 and ESA/390 instructions.
It can also emulate CKD and FBA DASD, printer, card reader, tape,
channel-to-channel adapter, and local non-SNA 3270 devices.
