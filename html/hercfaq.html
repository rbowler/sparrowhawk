<h1>Hercules: Frequently-Asked Questions</h1>
<hr noshade>
<h4>What is Hercules?</h4>
<p>
Hercules is a software implementation of S/370 and ESA/390
which runs under Linux on a Pentium PC.
<h4>So what exactly does that mean?</h4>
<p>
It means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor.
Hercules executes S/370 and ESA/390 instructions and channel programs.
It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using PC devices &#150; for
example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large files on your hard
disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270 sessions.
<p>
Hercules only implements the raw S/370 and ESA/390 instruction set; it
does not provide any operating system facilities.  This means that you
need to provide a standalone program or operating system which Hercules
can load from an emulated disk or tape device.  You will have to write
the standalone program or operating system yourself, unless you can
manage to obtain a license from IBM to run one of their operating
systems on your PC.
<h4>Is it functional enough to run production work?</h4>
<p>
No.  At the moment it's a system programmer's toy, though it's rapidly
becoming good enough to run a wide range of software without problems.
<h4>Can it run OS/390, VM/ESA, VSE/ESA?</h4>
<p>
Hercules is a software implementation of ESA/390, and so it is capable
of running OS/390, VSE/ESA, and the VM/ESA 370 Feature, as well as older
versions of these OSes.
Hercules will not run the ESA/390 version of VM/ESA because it does not
implement the required VM Assist and SIE instructions.
<p>
In practice you cannot run any ESA operating system on your
PC, unless you can obtain a license from IBM allowing you to do so.
It is believed that there are, however, three legal ways you could run
OS/390, VM/ESA 370 Feature, or VSE/ESA under Hercules:
<ol>
<li>running under Linux on the Pentium processor of a P/390 which is
    licensed to run the OS
<li>running under Linux/390 on a mainframe which is licensed to
    run the OS
<li>running under the terms of a disaster recovery provision of the OS
    license (but I really don't recommend depending on Hercules to be your
    disaster recovery solution!)
</ol>
<h4>So what <em>can</em> I run on it?</h4>
<p>
You can run OS/360 on Hercules in S/370 mode.  OS/360 is in the
public domain and (if my understanding is correct) can be run
without licensing problems.
<p>
Some standalone programs are known to run well.
I can particularly recommend Jan Jaeger's excellent standalone
editor (ZZSA) which you can download from
<a href="http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger">
http://home.worldonline.nl/~jjaeger</a>; I use it regularly to look at DASD
while debugging an OS installation, which is just what it's designed to do.
A copy of ZZSA is included in the Hercules distribution.
<h4>Where can I obtain OS/360?</h4>
<p>
Rick Fochtman's OS/360 archive CD is now obtainable by download from
these locations:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cyberdynesys.com/os360.tgz">
    http://www.cyberdynesys.com/os360.tgz</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/hercos360/os360.tar.gz">
    ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/hercos360/os360.tar.gz</a>
</ul>
If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the CD itself, contact
Rick Fochtman at <em>rfochtman </em>&#064;<em> ync.net</em>.
<p>
You can use the <code>dasdload</code> and <code>dasdisup</code> programs
(see the <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page)
to build an OS/360 IPL volume from the unloaded files on the
archive CD.
<p>
Alternatively, you can download my
<a href="mftr33.tar.gz">mftr33.tar.gz</a> package
which contains a minimal MFT system on a 3330 image, with
some minimal documentation.
<p>
I've produced a document describing how
to build an OS/360 system on Hercules.  It can be found at
<a href="http://www.conmicro.cx/hercos360">

<h4>What are the licensing restrictions for Hercules?</h4>
<p>
Hercules is a copyright work which has been made available for use
by any individual, subject to the terms of
the <a href="herclic.html">Hercules Public Licence</a>.
In essence this allows private individuals to freely copy, modify,
and execute the program for personal use.  You may not sell the
program, or copy any portion of the source code for use in any other
program.  Any modifications you make to the program are subject to
the same restrictions.  The Hercules Public Licence does not permit
any form of commercial use or distribution, except as a platform to develop
commercial software on. If you wish to use Hercules for
commercial purposes, drop me an email and we'll work out licensing terms.
<p>
Hercules is <em>not</em>, repeat, <em>not</em> GPL software!
<h4>What hardware do I need to run Hercules?</h4>
<p>
It depends how fast you want it to run.
A Pentium 166 with 16Mb RAM is probably the minimum practical
requirement; 550MHz with 128Mb RAM would be much better.  Hercules
doesn't use any fancy graphics, but it does need a fast processor to
achieve a reasonable MIPS rate.  A Celeron processor (with as high a
clock speed as you can afford) will probably give the best
price/performance ratio.
<p>
If you can afford a multiprocessor system, so much the better.
Hercules makes extensive use of multithreading to overlap I/O
with CPU activity, so you should find that a dual or quad Pentium
200 system will outperform a uniprocessor Pentium 450. My development system
is a Compaq ProLiant 6000 with four Pentium Pro 200s, and response time is
quite satisfactory.
<p>
Hercules does not depend on the Pentium architecture. I've built and run it
successfully on a 500 MHz Alpha 21164, and others have run it on SPARC and
S/390 (!) Linux systems. (One guy has even run OS/360 under Hercules under
Linux/390 under Hercules under Linux/390 under VM/ESA!) The only weirdness
about building the package on an Alpha is that you'll get compiler warnings
about "unsigned long value, unsigned long long format". You can ignore
these.
<p>
You will need enough Linux swap space to accommodate your S/390
real storage (main storage plus expanded storage).  For maximum
throughput, you should set your main and expanded storage sizes high
enough to eliminate S/390 paging.  S/390 storage is allocated out
of Linux virtual storage, so if you can provide enough RAM to
eliminate Linux paging as well, then so much the better.
<p>
You also need enough hard disk space to accommodate the emulated DASD.
A 3380 will need about 650MB, and a 3390 model 2 needs about 2GB.
<h4>What sort of MIPS rate can I expect?</h4>
<p>
Don't get excited...
on a Pentium Pro 200, I am seeing an execution speed of between 0.4
and 0.7 MIPS.
That's enough to run OS/360 (MFT or MVT) with a response time
similar to that of a 370/145 from the 1970's.  It's also fast enough
to run VSE/ESA with a slow but acceptable response time.  If you
want to run OS/390 you'd better wait until Intel processor speeds
get into the gigahertz range (which isn't that far off, now).
<p>
I haven't measured the I/O rate, but I would imagine it is
abysmal.
<h4>
<a name="software">
What software do I need to run Hercules?
</a>
</h4>
<p>
You need a Linux system with Posix Threads (pthread) support.
I will only provide support for Linux 2.2.x kernels with glibc2
(libc6) as supplied in popular distributions such as Red Hat 6.0 or later
and SuSE Linux 6.1 or later. My development system runs Red Hat 6.1.
<p>
You will also need tn3270 client software.  This does not have to run on the
Linux box. You can use any Windows tn3270 client (such as QWS3270, <a
href="http://www.tombrennansoftware.com">Vista tn3270</a>, IBM Personal
Communications, Attachmate Extra, or Dynacomm Elite), or any Unix tn3270
client (such as x3270).
<h4>Which compiler should I use to build Hercules?</h4>
<p>
You <em>must</em> use the egcs compiler.
I am using the version that came with Red Hat 6.1
and it seems to work OK.  The version number reported by cc -v
is: egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release).
<p>
The older gcc compiler is known to produce incorrect code for some
64-bit (unsigned long long) integer operations.
I have had reports that earlier versions of egcs produce
strange results too.
<p>
If you have both the gcc and egcs compilers installed, use the CC
parameter on the make command to force it to choose
the correct compiler:
<br><code>make CC=egcs</code>
<h4>Why do I get an unexpected fixed-point divide exception
    (program check 0009 or abend 0C9) on a CVB instruction?</h4>
<p>
You are using the gcc compiler.
You must use the egcs compiler instead.
See previous question for the required compiler level.
<h4>Do you plan to port Hercules to other platforms?</h4>
<p>
No.  I do not have the resources to support more than one operating
system.
<p>
If you want to make Hercules run on Windows, FreeBSD, Solaris,
Linux 2.0.x, or whatever, then by all means go ahead.  I welcome
reports of any bugs or problems you find, but I probably won't fix
problems if it means introducing platform-specific code, and I
will not be able to test new releases against other platforms.
<p>
The Hercules code is not intended to be specific to Intel hardware,
so if you find any issues or faults related to running on other
hardware (SPARC, Alpha, PPC, ...) under Linux 2.2, then I'm likely
to be more receptive to fixing that sort of problem than fixing
issues related to Unix variants (if I haven't found them already on my
Alpha).
<h4>How can I create a DASD volume?</h4>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes.
<h4>How can I read a mainframe tape volume?</h4>
<p>
The <b><i>tapeconv.jcl</i></b> file in the Hercules directory
contains a sample program which you can run under OS/390 on your
mainframe system.  It reads a file from tape and converts it to
AWSTAPE format.   Download the AWSTAPE file to your PC (making sure
to choose <em>binary</em> format for the download), and then add the
downloaded filename to the Hercules configuration file as a virtual
tape device.
<p>
<em>Note: the tapeconv program will not correctly
process input tapes whose blocksize exceeds 32760!</em>
One symptom of this may be
<code>ADRY011E I/O ERROR - DEVICE NOT ATTACHED.0000,NA,00...00,0000</code>
when attempting to restore from tape originally created
using the default DF/DSS blocksize.  The solution is to recreate
the dump tape with DCB=BLKSIZE=32760.
<h4>Can I attach a tape drive to Hercules?</h4>
<p>
Hercules can read and write SCSI tapes.  I have tested this with 
4mm DAT, QIC-1000, and 9-track drives. It is possible to obtain 3480 type
drives which attach to the SCSI bus, so in theory it should be
possible to read real mainframe cartridges using Hercules.
Unfortunately, these drives are shockingly expensive (about 10,000
dollars apiece last time I enquired), so unless someone wants to
donate one to me, this tantalising possibility will have to remain
in the realms of fantasy for the time being.
<h4>How can I create programs without a mainframe?</h4>
<p>
If you want to write standalone programs to run on Hercules, but
you don't have access to a mainframe, then there are two interesting
products which you can run on your PC:
<dl>
<dt>
The "Tachyon 390 Cross Assembler"
(<a href="http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon">
http://www.tachyonsoft.com/tachyon</a>)
<dd>
With this assembler you can produce S/390 compatible object decks
using your Linux or Windows PC.  A high degree of HLASM
compatibility, coupled with the ability to perform complex assemblies
at lightning speed, make this a product which is well worth looking at.
I have tried this assembler and it is truly amazing.
<dt>
The "Dignus Systems/C Compiler"
(<a href="http://www.dignus.com">
http://www.dignus.com</a>)
<dd>This is a C compiler that runs under Windows or Linux and generates
mainframe assembler code which you can then assemble using the
Tachyon assembler.
</dl>
<p>
Sam Golob wrote a fascinating review of these two products in
the September 1999 issue of NaSPA Technical Support magazine.
