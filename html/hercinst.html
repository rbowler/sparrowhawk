<h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
<a name="instsource"></a>
<h3>Building from source - Windows</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="http://downloads.hercules-390.eu/hercules-3.11.zip">hercules-3.11.zip</a>
<li>
Hercules for Windows is built using the Microsoft Visual C (MSVC) compiler.
Refer to file README.WIN32 or README.WIN64 for details.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Building from source - Mac OS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Install <b>Xcode</b> from the
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835">
App Store</a>.
<li>Install <b>Homebrew</b> using the procedure described
at <a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>
<li>Use these commands to install pre-requisite software:
<br><code>brew install autoconf</code>
<br><code>brew install automake</code>
<br><code>brew install gnu-sed</code>
<br><code>automake --add-missing</code>
<li>Proceed with <i>Building from source - Linux and Mac OS X</i> below.
</ol>

<h3>Building from source - Linux and Mac OS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the distribution file
<a href="http://downloads.hercules-390.eu/hercules-3.11.tar.gz">hercules-3.11.tar.gz</a>
<br><em>Note:</em> By downloading this file you agree to the terms
    of the <a href="herclic.html">Q Public Licence</a>.
<p>
<li>Use these commands to unzip the distribution file:
<pre>tar xvzf ../hercules-3.11.tar.gz
cd hercules-3.11</pre>

<li>Verify you have all of the correct versions of all of the
required packages installed:

<p><code>./util/bldlvlck</code>

<p><li>Configure Hercules for your system:

<p><code>./configure</code>

<p>By default, the configure script will attempt to guess appropriate
      compiler optimization flags for your system.  If its guesses
      turn out to be wrong, you can disable all optimization by
      passing the <code>--disable-optimization</code> option to
      configure, or specify your own optimization flags with
      <code>--enable-optimization=FLAGS</code>

<p>For additional configuration options, run: <code>./configure
          --help</code>

<p><li>Build the executables: <p><code>make</code>

<p><li>Install the programs: as root: <p><code>make install</code>
</ol>

<p>
<em>Important:</em>
You must use at least version 3.00 of the gcc compiler and the glibc2 library.
Refer to the <a href="hercfaq.html#3.04">
Hercules Frequently-Asked Questions</a> page for required
compiler and other software levels.

<a name="instbinary"></a>
<!--
<h3>Installing pre-built RPMs:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download the RPM file you want:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://downloads.hercules-390.eu/hercules-3.11.i686.rpm">hercules-3.11.i686.rpm</a>: 32-bit Intel
<li><a href="http://downloads.hercules-390.eu/hercules-3.11.x86_64.rpm">hercules-3.11.x86_64.rpm</a>: 64-bit Intel
</ul>
<li>Install the RPM:
<br><code>rpm -Uvh</code> <i>RPMfile</i>
</ol>
<p>
This will leave the Hercules executables in /usr/bin and the dynamic
libraries in /usr/lib and /usr/lib/hercules, where you can run them
from anywhere. Sample configuration files will be placed in /etc/hercules,
and the IPLable card deck for the ZZSA standalone utility will be placed in
/var/share/hercules.
-->

<!--
<h3>Installing pre-built Debian packages:</h3>
<p>
Debian packages are available for "woody" and later releases.

<ul>
<li>Using apt: <code>apt-get install hercules</code>
<li>Manually with dpkg:
  <ol>
    <li>Download a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hercules">.deb
        package</a>
    <li><code>dpkg -i</code> <i>DEB</i>
  </ol>
</ul>
</p>
-->

<!--
<h3>Installing on Gentoo Linux:</h3>
<p>Hercules is installed like any other Gentoo package: do <code>emerge
--sync</code> if you haven't done it lately, then <code>emerge
hercules</code>.</p>
<p>Do not try to override the optimization flags automatically selected by
<code>configure</code>. Hercules stresses the gcc optimizer, and will break
in subtle ways if the wrong optimization settings are used.</p>
-->

<h3>Installing pre-built binaries for Mac OS X:</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://brew.sh>Homebrew">Homebrew</a> may be used to install
Hercules on a Mac with an Intel processor and OS X 10.5 or above.
<ol>
<li>Homebrew requires <b>Xcode</b> which can be installed from the
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835">
App Store</a>.
<li>Install <b>Homebrew</b> using the procedure described
at <a href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>
<li>Enter these commands at a terminal prompt:
<br><code>brew help</code>
<br><code>brew doctor</code>
<br><code>brew install hercules</code>
</ol>

<p><hr><a name="config"></a>
<h2>Configuration Procedure</h2>
<p>
You will need to amend the configuration file
<em><b>hercules.cnf</b></em> to reflect your device layout and intended
mode of operation (S/370, ESA/390, or z/Architecture).
See the <a href="hercconf.html">Hercules Configuration File</a> page for
a complete description.

<p><hr><a name="dasd"></a>
<h2>Creating DASD volumes</h2>
<p>
The <a href="hercload.html">Creating Hercules DASD</a> page
describes various methods of creating and loading virtual DASD
volumes. The compressed CKD DASD support is described in <a
href="cckddasd.html">this page</a>.

<p><hr><a name="operating"></a>
<h2>Operating Procedure</h2>
<a name="starting">
<p class="warning">
<em>Note: If you intend to run any licensed software on your PC
using Hercules, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not
violate the software vendor's licensing terms.</em>

<h4>Starting Hercules</h4>
<p>
To start Hercules enter this command at the Unix or Windows command prompt:
<code><pre>
    hercules  [ -f <em>filename</em> ]
              [ -d ]
              [ -p <em>dyndir</em> ]  [[-l <em>dynmod</em> ] ... ]
              [ &gt; <em>logfile</em> ]
</pre></code>
<p>
where:
<dl>
        <dt><code><em>filename</em></code><p><dd>

            is the name of the configuration file.
            The default, if none is specified, is <b><em>hercules.cnf</em></b>.
            The default may be overridden via the <code>HERCULES_CNF</code>
            environment variable.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>-d</em></code><p><dd>

            specifies that Hercules is to be run in 'daemon' mode,
            wherein it runs invisibly with no attached console.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>dyndir</em></code><p><dd>

            is the directory from which dynamic modules are to be loaded.
            The default depends on the host platform on which Hercules
            is being run. This option overrides the default.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>dynmod</em></code><p><dd>

            is the name of an additional dynamic module to be loaded
            at startup. More than one additional module may be specified,
            although each must be preceded with the <code>-l</code>
            option specifier.
        <p>
        <dt><code><em>logfile</em></code><p><dd>

            is an optional log file which will receive a copy of
            all messages displayed on the control panel
        <p>
</dl>

<p>
Next connect a tn3270 client to the console port (normally port 3270).
The client will be connected to the first 3270 device address specified
in the configuration file (this should be the master console address).
If your master console is a 1052 or 3215, connect a telnet client
instead of a tn3270 client.

<p>
Now you can enter an ipl command from the control panel.

<h4>Using the keyboard</h4>
<p>

The main Hercules screen contains a scrollable list of messages with a command
input area and system status line at the bottom of the screen.
<p>
To scroll through the messages, use either the Page Up or Page Down keys,
the Ctrl + Up Arrow or Ctrl + Down Arrow keys, or the Home or End and/or
the Ctrl + Home or Ctrl + End keys.
<p>
Important messages are highlighted in a different color (usually red) and are
prevented from being scrolled off the screen for two minutes. If Extended Cursor
handling is available then important messages currently at the top of the screen
can be removed early by moving the cursor to the line containing the message
and then pressing enter.
<p>
Use the Insert key to switch between insert and overlay mode when typing in
the command input area. Use the Home and End keys to move to the first or
last character of the command you are typing, or the use the left/right arrow keys
to move to a specific character. Use the Escape key to erase the input area.
<p>
Pressing Escape when the command input area is already empty causes the screen
to switch to the semi-graphical "New Panel" display mode, which shows the overall
status of the system and devices.
<p>
When in the semi-graphical "New Panel" display mode there is no command input
area. Instead, single character "hot keys" are used to issue some of the more
common functions such as starting or stopping the CPU. The hot-keys are those
which are highlighted. Pressing the '?' key displays brief help information
on how to use the semi-graphical panel.

<p>
The <em>ipl</em> command may also be used to perform a load from cdrom or
server.  For example if a standard SuSE S/390 Linux distribution CD is loaded
and mounted on /cdrom for example, this cdrom may then be ipl-ed by:
<em>ipl /cdrom/suse.ins</em>
<p>
The <em>attach</em> and <em>detach</em> commands are used to dynamically
add or remove devices from the configuration,
and the <em>define</em> command can be used to alter the device number
of an existing device.
<p>
The <em>devinit</em> command can be used to reopen an existing device.
The <em>args</em> (if specified) override the arguments
specified in the configuration file for this device.
The device type cannot be changed and must not be specified.
This command can be used to rewind a tape, to mount a new tape or
disk image file on an existing device, to load a new card deck
into a reader, or to close and reopen a printer or punch device.
<p>
In single-step mode, pressing the enter key will advance to the
next instruction.
<p>
There is also an alternate semi-graphical control panel.  Press Esc to
switch between the command line format and the semi-graphical format.
Press ? to obtain help in either control panel.
<p>
Some commands also offer additional help information regarding their syntax,
etc. Enter&nbsp; "<tt>help <i>&lt;command name&gt;</i></tt>" &nbsp; to display
this additional help information. (Note: not every command supports help)
<p>
When a command is prefixed with '-', the the command will not be redisplayed at
the console. This can be used in scripts and is also used internally when commands
are to be invoked without being redisplayed at the panel.

<a name="RCFILE">
<h4>The &nbsp;hercules.rc &nbsp;(run-commands)&nbsp; file</h4>
</a>
<p>
Hercules also supports the ability to automatically execute panel commands
upon startup via the 'run-commands' file. If the run-commands file
is found to exist when Hercules starts, each line contained within it is
read and interpreted as a panel command exactly as if the command were
entered from the HMC system console.
<p>
The default filename for the run-commands file is "hercules.rc", but may be
overridden by setting the "<tt><b>HERCULES_RC</b></tt>" environment variable to the
desired filename.
<p>
Except for the 'pause' command (see paragraph further below), each command
read from the run-commands file is logged to the console preceded by a '> '
(greater-than sign) character so you can easily distinguish between panel
commands entered from the keyboard from those entered via the .rc file.
<p>
Lines starting with '<tt>#</tt>' are treated as "silent comments" and are
thus not logged to the console. Line starting with '<tt>*</tt>' however are
treated as "loud comments" and <i>will</i> be logged.
<p>
In addition to being able to execute any valid panel command (including the
'sh' shell command) via the run-commands file, an additional
'<tt><b>pause <i>nnn</i></b></tt>' command is supported in order to introduce
a brief delay before reading and processing the next line in the file. The
value <tt><i>nnn</i></tt> can be any number from 1 to 999 and specifies the
number of seconds to delay before reading the next line. Creative use of the
run-commands file can completely automate Hercules startup.
<p>
<hr width="50%">

<a name="HAO">
<h4>The "Hercules Automatic Operator" (HAO) Facility</h4>
</a>
<p>
The Hercules Automatic Operator (HAO) feature is a facility which can
automatically issue panel commands in response to specific messages
appearing on the Hercules console.
<p>
To use the Hercules Automatic Operator facility, you first define a "rule"
consisting of a "target" and an associated "command". The "target" is
a regular expression pattern used to match against the text of the various
messages that Hercules issues as it runs. Whenever a match is found, the
rule "fires" and its associated command is automatically issued.
<p>
The Hercules Automatic Operator facility only operates on messages issued
to the Hercules console. These messages may originate from Hercules itself,
or from the guest operating system via the SCP SYSCONS interface or via the
integrated console printer-keyboard (3215-C or 1052-C). HAO cannot intercept
messages issued by the guest operating system to its own terminals.

<h5>Defining a Rule</h5>
<p>
To define a HAO rule, enter the command:
<pre>
   hao tgt <i>target</i>
</pre>
<p>
to define the rule's "target" match pattern
followed by the command:
<pre>
   hao cmd <i>command</i>
</pre>
<p>
to define the rule's associated panel-command.
<p>
The <i>target</i> is a regular expression as defined by your host platform.
When running on Linux, Hercules uses POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax.
On a Windows platform, regular expression support is provided by
Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE).
The HAO facility can only be used if regular expression support was included
in Hercules at build time.
<p>
The associated <i>command</i> is whatever valid Hercules panel command you
wish to issue in response to a message being issued that matches the given
<i>target</i> pattern.

<h5>Substituting substrings in the command</h5>
<p>
The <i>command</i> may contain special variables $1, $2, etc, which will be
replaced by the values of "capturing groups" in the match pattern.
A capturing group is a part of the regular expression enclosed in parentheses
which is matched with text in the target message. In this way, commands may be
constructed which contain substrings extracted from the message which
triggered the command.
<p>
The following special variables are recognized:
<ul>
<li><code>$1</code> to <code>$9</code> -
    the text which matched the 1st to 9th capturing
    group in the target regular expression
<li><code>$`</code> - the text preceding the regular expression match
<li><code>$'</code> - the text following the regular expression match
<li><code>$$</code> - replaced by a single dollar sign
</ul>
<p>
Note that substitution of a $<i>n</i> variable does not occur if there are
fewer than <i>n</i> capturing groups in the regular expression.
<p>
As an example, the rule below issues the command 'i 001F' in response to
the message HHCTE014I 3270 device 001F client 127.0.0.1 connection reset:
<pre>
   hao tgt HHCTE014I 3270 device ([0-9A-F]{3,4})
   hao cmd i $1
</pre>
<p>
Another example, shown below, illustrates how the dot matrix display of a
3480 tape unit might be used to implement an automatic tape library:
<pre>
   hao tgt HHCTA010I ([0-9A-F]{4}): Now Displays: (?:".{8}" / )?"M([A-Z0-9]{1,6})\s*S"
   hao cmd devinit $1 /u/tapes/$2.awstape
</pre>

<h5>Other commands and limitations</h5>
<p>
To delete a fully or partially defined HAO rule, first use the 'hao list'
command to list all of the defined (or partially defined) rules, and then use
the 'hao del <i>nnn</i>' command to delete the specific rule identified by
<i>nnn</i> (all rules are assigned numbers as they are defined and are thus
identified by their numeric value). Optionally, you can delete all defined or
partially defined rules by issuing the command 'hao clear'.
<p>
The current implementation limits the total number of defined rules to 64.
This limit may be raised by  increasing the value of the HAO_MAXRULE
constant in hao.c and rebuilding Hercules.
<p>
All defined rules are checked for a match each time Hercules issues a message.
There is no way to specify "stop processing subsequent rules". If a message is
issued that matches two or more rules, each associated command is then issued
in sequence.
