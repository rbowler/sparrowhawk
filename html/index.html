<h1>The Hercules System/370 and ESA/390 Emulator</h1>
<hr noshade>
<p>
My first experience with a computer was at HemisFair '68 in San Antonio. IBM
had a pavilion there with a 360/30 driving 8 or so 2260s. It ran a program
that would tell you exactly how old you were, down to the second. Pretty
mundane stuff now, but to an 8-year-old...<br>
I broke into systems work 12 years later, doing MVS on a 370/158AP. It was
fun...but I wanted a box of my own. The long series of PCs I've owned since
then have been fun, but nothing quite captures the flavor of running the big
iron like, well, running the big iron.<p>
<p>
That is, until now...
<p>
Hercules is a System/370 and ESA/390 emulator which can IPL and
execute S/370 and ESA/390 instructions.
It can also emulate CKD and FBA DASD, printer, card reader, tape,
channel-to-channel adapter, and local non-SNA 3270 devices.

<em>&#147;
Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to see OS
running on a machine that I personally own.
Hercules is a marvelous tool.  My thanks to you all for a job
very well done.

I do miss my mainframe a lot, and playing with Herc sure brings back
memories.  Just seeing the IBM message prefixes, and responding to
console messages again was a wonderful bit of nostalgia!

I have installed your absolutely fantastic /390 emulator.
You won't believe what I felt when I saw the prompt.
Congratulations, this is a terrific software.
I really have not had such a fascinating and interesting
time on my PC lately.
